Matlab/Simulink Code for my book **Tutorial for Modeling and Simulation of Biological Processes** available [online](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MRFH8ZW).

This tutorial is a great practical step-by-step approach to mathematical modeling, identifiability analysis, parameters
estimation, sensibility analysis, dynamical system identification and optimal experimental design. These concepts are illustrated with pharmacokinetics models and models of population dynamics. Advanced topics are covered using examples of mathematical models of cardiovascular mechanics, autonomic control of heart rate, neuron action potential and electrocardiogram.

After using this material, Bachelor and Master students should be able to resolve modeling and simulation tasks encountered in Biomedical Engineering with greater comfort. The tutorial is a potential tool for teachers and coaches who can fetch useful information for exercises and labs. The text grew out of a class and lab taught by the author at the Czech Technical University in Prague over several years.
